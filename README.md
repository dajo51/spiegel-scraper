# Spiegel Scraper

Script to scrape articles and whole issuses including metadata from the Spiegel magazine archive.

## Getting started

Adjust config.yaml to your scraping needs. This project uses pipenv, so make sure it's installed.

Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pipenv install
```

Make sure the virtual environment is activated by checken

```bash
pipenv shell
```

After that you can start the scraper with:

```bash
pipenv run scraper
```

If this does not work, you can run the main.py manually.

Happy scraping!
